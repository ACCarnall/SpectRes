    Function for resampling spectra (and optionally associated
    uncertainties) onto a new wavelength basis.

    Parameters
    ----------

    new_wavs : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the new wavelength sampling desired for the
        spectrum or spectra.

    spec_wavs : numpy.ndarray
        1D array containing the current wavelength sampling of the
        spectrum or spectra.

    spec_fluxes : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing spectral fluxes at the wavelengths specified in
        spec_wavs, last dimension must correspond to the shape of
        spec_wavs. Extra dimensions before this may be used to include
        multiple spectra.

    spec_errs : numpy.ndarray (optional)
        Array of the same shape as spec_fluxes containing uncertainties
        associated with each spectral flux value.

    fill : float (optional)
        Where new_wavs extends outside the wavelength range in spec_wavs
        this value will be used as a filler in new_fluxes and new_errs.

    verbose : bool (optional)
        Setting verbose to False will suppress the default warning about
        new_wavs extending outside spec_wavs and "fill" being used.

    Returns
    -------

    new_fluxes : numpy.ndarray
        Array of resampled flux values, first dimension is the same
        length as new_wavs, other dimensions are the same as
        spec_fluxes.

    new_errs : numpy.ndarray
        Array of uncertainties associated with fluxes in new_fluxes.
        Only returned if spec_errs was specified.
